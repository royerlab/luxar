# Changelog

All notable changes to Luxar are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### December 2025

#### Major Features

**Modular Theming System** 🎨
- **What**: Complete theming system with runtime theme switching, CSS-based architecture, and accessibility support
- **Themes**: 3 production-ready themes (Dark, Light, High Contrast WCAG AAA)
- **Components**: All 8 UI components fully themed (error dialogs, help overlay, dimension sliders, debug console, dataset browser, data loading monitor, rendering controls)
- **Architecture**: Three-layer system (Theme definitions → CSS files → Component logic)
- **Features**:
  - Instant theme switching via UI dropdown (R key → 🎨 Theme)
  - URL parameter support (`?theme=light`)
  - Automatic persistence via localStorage
  - 130+ CSS utility classes with BEM naming
  - 80+ CSS custom properties (`--luxar-*`)
  - Zero hardcoded colors in components
  - Consistent 0.15s fade-in animation across all UI panels
- **Benefits**:
  - 400+ inline styles removed (-90% inline styling)
  - CSS bundle: 48KB (6.77KB gzipped) - cacheable separately
  - JS bundle: -13KB reduction
  - Better accessibility (WCAG AAA high-contrast theme)
  - Easier maintenance (single source of truth for colors)
- **Testing**: 1074 unit tests + 21 E2E visual regression tests
- **Implementation**: 15 commits, 4,114 lines added, 100% complete with final polish
- **Location**: `src/themes/`, `src/styles/`, UI components
- **Documentation**: Complete implementation plan in `docs/guides/developer/THEMING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### January 2025

#### Critical Bug Fixes

**Transform Composition Bug**
- **Issue**: Matrix multiplication order was reversed in `compose()` function (left-multiply instead of right-multiply)
- **Impact**: `compose(T1, T2, T3)` was applying T3 first instead of T1 first
- **Fix**: Changed `result = transform @ result` to `result = result @ transform`
- **Location**: `core/transforms.py:271`
- **Lesson**: Order matters for non-commutative transforms (rotate+translate). Always test with order-sensitive operations.

**Points Metadata Loss Bug**
- **Issue**: `Points.__init__()` set `self._metadata` before calling `super().__init__()`, then `Node.__init__()` overwrote it with empty dict
- **Impact**: ALL Points objects lost their metadata (has_colors, has_radii, max_radius, etc.)
- **Fix**: Call `super().__init__()` BEFORE setting `self._metadata` in Points class
- **Location**: `core/points.py:50-58`
- **Lesson**: When subclass and parent both initialize the same attribute, parent must initialize first

**Fullscreen Resize Bug**
- **Issue**: Point sizes changed incorrectly on first fullscreen toggle or window resize
- **Root Cause**: Scene initialization didn't call `updateSize()`, causing different behavior on first resize
- **Solution**: Make initialization call `this.updateSize()` in `scene-manager.ts` init() method
- **Lesson**: Ensure initialization and resize paths are identical to avoid first-time-only bugs

#### Code Cleanup

**Legacy Code Removed**
- Eliminated unused "legacy mode" from Node class (~40 lines dead code)
- Removed `group` parameter and all `if self._group is not None:` branches
- Node now only supports progressive writing mode (simpler, clearer)

**Deprecated Parameters Removed**
- Removed `units` parameter from `LuxarZarrCompiler` (use Dimensions instead)
- Removed `DimensionMetadata` class (use full-featured `Dimension` instead)
- Removed unused version constants (LEGACY, PREVIOUS, FUTURE)
- Total: ~160 lines of dead/deprecated code removed

#### Quality Improvements

**Compiler Refactoring**
- Reduced `write_points()` from 432 to 117 lines (73% reduction)
- Extracted 8 focused helper methods with single responsibilities

**Validation Consolidation**
- Created `validation/types.py` centralizing all validation
- Eliminated ~350 lines of duplication between `protocols.py` and `validation/base.py`
- Clear organization: types.py (basic), base.py (detailed for writing), nd.py (dimensional)

**Transform Handling Centralized**
- Added `read_transform_from_zarr()` companion function
- Single source of truth for NumPy to THREE.js transform conversion
- Eliminated ~50 lines of duplicate transpose logic

**Magic Numbers Extracted**
- Created 18 named constants for spatial index tuning
- All grid sizing heuristics now configurable via constants

**Performance**
- Vectorized HSV to RGB conversion in demos (30-100x faster)

**Documentation**
- Added 80+ inline comments explaining complex algorithms

#### New Features

**Debug Console & Console Logging**
- In-App Debug Console: Press Ctrl+L to toggle debug console
- Ring Buffer Implementation: Console interceptor uses 10,000 message ring buffer
- Early Message Capture: Console messages captured from app initialization
- Standardized Logging: All console logs use format: `[emoji] [Luxar] message`
- Debug Interface: Debug tools available at `window.__luxarDebug` when `?debug` URL param is present

**HDR Color Pipeline**
- Float32 Colors: Changed from Uint8Array to Float32Array for HDR support
- nD Slicing Fix: Updated slicing algorithms to use `sliceColorsFloat32()` for proper HDR colors
- HDR Detection: Added comprehensive HDR capability detection in `utils/hdr-detection.ts`
- Note: WebGL canvas doesn't support true HDR output (limited to 8-bit)

**World-Space Point Sizing**
- Physical Accuracy: Points now use world-space sizing instead of screen-space
- Key Property: Two points with radius r at distance 2r will just touch
- FOV Independence: Points maintain physical size regardless of field of view changes
- Formula: `angularSize = 2 * atan(radius/distance)`, then converted to pixels

**nD Visualization**
- Slicing Tolerance: Use point radius for visibility, not fixed tolerance
- Scene Dimensions: Always define at scene level for consistency
- Keyboard Navigation: Simple 2-step: select dimension (1-9), navigate ([/])
- TypeScript Integration: Scene dimensions loaded from zarr attrs, used for step sizes

**Data Loading Architecture Refactor**
- Removed Lazy Loading: Eliminated LazyDataManager in favor of spatial index-based loading
- Spatial Index Required: All datasets now require spatial indices for efficient loading
- Range-Based Caching: New RangeCache system for intelligent memory management
- Improved Monitoring: Enhanced DataLoadingMonitor with better error handling and disposal
- Cleaner Architecture: Removed intermediate abstractions for simpler, more maintainable code
